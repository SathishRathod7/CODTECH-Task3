**Overview of Geospatial Analysis**

Objectives:           
  1.Visualize Restaurant Locations: Plot the geographic locations of restaurants using their latitude and longitude information.             
  2.Analyze Distribution Across Regions: Explore the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries to identify patterns               
  3.Correlation Analysis: Investigate whether there is any correlation between the geographic location of restaurants and their ratings.                                
  
Key Activities:                    
 1.Visualize Locations on a Map:                  
  *Use latitude and longitude data to plot restaurant locations on an interactive map.                     
  *Highlight key areas with dense concentrations of restaurants.                         

2.Distribution Analysis:                 
  *Analyze the number of restaurants in different cities or countries.               
  *Visualize the geographic distribution using heat maps or density plots.               

3.Correlation Between Location and Rating:               
  *Compare the geographic distribution of restaurant ratings.          
  *Use statistical methods to determine if there is a significant correlation between a restaurant's location and its rating.                   
  
Technology Used:            

Programming Language:                 
  *Python: A versatile programming language widely used for data analysis and preprocessing.               

Libraries and Tools:               
  *Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including handling missing values and data type conversions.              
  *NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.            
  *Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.              
  *Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, particularly useful for exploring and understanding the distribution of variables.
